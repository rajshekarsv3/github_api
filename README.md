A Simple Github API task

This application is live at https://fathomless-scrubland-6063.herokuapp.com/



=> Used ExpressJS for the first time to do this task(https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started)
=> Used nodejs github library (https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github)
=> Fetched No of Repository's Issues(These response also included pull requests)
=> Grouped all the issues into one
=> did this to avoid multiple API calls
=> Differenciated issues and pull requests
=> Checking conditions like valid repository,issues enabled, No issues

=> Provided Time, We can also display the link for Issues,
=> We can also group it by labels
=> Filter it by assignees,creators
